description: Starting a tutorial for building Serverless Lambdas in Rust
---
I started learning Serverless with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).


 Here is a quick tutorial I started creating, [rust_lambda_hello_world](https://github.com/millerjam/rust_lambda_hello_world). This is a simple "hello world" lambda that uses the 
[AWS Lambda Rust Runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime). 
It walks through creating the new project, adding crates, and how to cross compile for Amazon Linux 2 on x86. Finally, create a new AWS lambda function and invoke using the cli.

It was fun to get this started and there are a lot of additional things I can add around testing, logging.
